# Memory-Game
Project



I was making this project in 2014 in the high school, is very interesting and good for to learn about
matrix of a dinamic way, for the fact  that is better to learn playing, with the time 
I going to make  more changes little by little.

In this game we are going to have two matrix, the first is for to save images the game and 
the second is for to save numbers(it's logic matrix)

From view the users is a hard game, because the first image can to display but the next image can't to display, for that reason you need a lot attention in each image.

I hope you like it
