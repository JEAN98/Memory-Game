# Memory-Game
Project



I completed this project in 2014 during my high school years, it's  interesting and good if you want to learn about
matrix of a dinamic way. In future days I will make  more changes.

In this game we are going to have two matrices, the first one is focused on to save images of the game and 
the second one is to save numbers(it's called like logic matrix)

From the user perspective, this could be a really hard game, because the first image is going to be displayed until the user selects a new one, based on this you need to pay a lot of attention in each image.

I hope you like it
